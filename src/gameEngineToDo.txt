TO DO NOTES Updated 2/4/2021

- A basic check for Level/SceneTriggers has been done 

- Set up ENVColObject struct in objectDefs.h? 

- Store the pointer to an array of these ENVColObject structs in SceneManager for the courtyard (levelDefs.h and main.c)

- key scripts located in level00.c, transformDefs.h, collisionDefs, env00_col_courtyard_walls.c, collisioncheck.c

- //TO DO NOTE: Set up ENVColObject to store in each courtyard scene for lvl00_courtyard_col_wall01_MeshVtx 

- //TO DO NOTE: Set up SectorTrigger to determine where to check for collisions
- //TO DO NOTE: Set up SectorTrigger to load events, texture animation, enemy behavior and collision checks.


















DONE 2/4/2021

- TEST Sector trigger has been done to load level geometry, but needs to be changed to instead make a collision check
- TEST LevelTrigger and SceneTrigger to load level geometry. WORKS in level00.c with simple testing 
- Now that the format for LevelTrigger, SceneTrigger, and SectorTrigger are worked out, set it up to test in game
